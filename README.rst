Minimal Edx Platform Fork For Allowing LTI 1.3 Parameter Processors Under ``open-release/lilac.1``
==================================================================================================

This is a fork of the Edx Platform at tag ``open-release/lilac.1``: https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/tree/open-release/lilac.1.

There is a single, tiny change:
    - The version of lti-consumer-xblock dependency is pinned at ``lti-consumer-xblock==3.0.3``

This repository is meant as a temporary development convenience for those deploying their dev environments via Tutor, and it will likely be deleted upon the next open release of the Open Edx Platform.
